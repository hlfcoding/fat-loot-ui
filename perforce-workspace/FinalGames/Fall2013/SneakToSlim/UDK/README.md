# Legacy File Structure

This is the original structure of the class project, and is obviously not ideal,
but also wasn't my decision to make. `SneakToSlim` is the original project name.
The side branch `Development/` separately stores the CLIK library. The main
branch `UDKGame/` stores the Flash app under `test/`, where the action's at.
