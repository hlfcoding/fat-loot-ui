# Design

Creating the graphics in the application was also mostly my doing. Most of the
general art direction and concept art came from above.

`main-menu-mockups.psd` is the main PSD file with all the screens. Each screen is
composed of separate graphics using `main-menu-flash-swatches.clr` and `main-
menu-styles.asl` that are exported with `main-menu-actions.atn`. The styles
library contains the texture images and so is the largest non-PSD file.

As for the rest of the files, some are raw concept art and their respective,
sometimes retouched, PSD versions for slicing and exporting. Some are logos or
maps and their exported versions.
